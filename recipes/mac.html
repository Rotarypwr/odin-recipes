    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8oz) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
